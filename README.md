Collaborative vs. Content Recommender Systems
Collaborative Recommender Systems:
In context of a movie recommender, collaborative filters find trends in how similar users rate movies based on rating profiles. 
There are various methods:
1.	ALS (Alternating Least Squares)

Advantages:
It is self-generating. Users create data naturally as they interact with items. 
Drawbacks:
Cold-start problem. 
It arises when there is little information available for the item/user. 
For example: in our scenario, if a new movie or a new user gets added we wonâ€™t be able to predict anything as it does not have a past behaviour.
